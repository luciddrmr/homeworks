Various Rules of Thumb that May Be Useful In Scheme
===================================================

  * If you see an error message from the parser that you don't understand, assume it's a paren matching
    problem until you convince yourself otherwise.

  * Paste the smallest amount of code possible into its own file, and see if you can produce
    the error with a tiny expression rather than all your code.
