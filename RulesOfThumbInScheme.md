Various Rules of Thumb that May Be Useful In Scheme
===================================================

(or really, any programming lang you're learning but don't know very well yet.)

  * If you see an error message from the parser that you don't understand, assume it's a paren matching
    problem until you convince yourself otherwise.

  * Paste the smallest amount of code possible into its own file, and see if you can produce
    the error with a tiny expression rather than all your code.

  * Check to make sure things are 0 based or 1 based, such as arrays, string functions, and the like.
    In Scheme and most languages, 0 base is common, but there is Pascal after all. :)
