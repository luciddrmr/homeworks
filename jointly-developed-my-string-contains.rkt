; jointly-developed-my-string-contains
;   This is the version of my-string-contains that Carol and Bradley developed together,
;    applying our list of design patterns.

;        (my-string-contains? s t) â†’ boolean?

;      s : string
;      t : string
;   Determines whether the first string appears literally in the second one.
