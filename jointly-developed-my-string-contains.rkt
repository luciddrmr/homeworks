; jointly-developed-my-string-contains
;   This is the version of my-string-contains that Carol and Bradley developed together,
;    applying our list of design patterns.

;        (my-string-contains? s t) â†’ boolean?

;      s : string
;      t : string
;   Determines whether the first string appears literally in the second one. 


(define my-string-contains? (lambda str1 str2)
  ; Probably we're done if there's no str2 left.
  
  
;Sub problems:
  ; we need an expression that returns true iff. the first character of string1 and string2 are equivalent.
(equal? (substring str1 0 1) (substring str2 0 1))
